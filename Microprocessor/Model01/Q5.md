## what are the typical characteristics of cisc instruction set architecture? expain.

CISC is a type of CPU architecture that provides a large set of complex instructions, each capable of executing multiple low-level operations (like memory access, arithmetic, or control) in a single instruction.

### Typical Characteristics of CISC:

1. Large Number of Instructions:
2. Complex Instructions:
3. Variable Instruction Length:
4. Multiple Addressing Modes:
5. Memory-to-Memory Operations:
6. Fewer Registers:
7. Microprogrammed Control:
8. Emphasis on Reducing Instruction Count:

### Example of CISC Instruction:

* ADD AX, [1000H] â†’ fetches a value from memory, adds it to register AX, all in one instruction.
