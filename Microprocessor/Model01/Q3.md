# Explain the arithmetic pipeline with example.

An arithmetic pipeline is a technique used in CPUs to improve the execution speed of arithmetic operations by dividing them into smaller stages.

* Each stage performs a part of the operation, and different instructions can be processed simultaneously at different stages.

* This is similar to an assembly line in a factory.

### Example: 4-Stage Addition Pipeline

Suppose we want to perform addition of two numbers:

### Stages:

* Stage 1: Fetch operands from registers

* Stage 2: Align operands (like in multi-digit addition)

* Stage 3: Perform addition of digits

* Stage 4: Store the result back to register

| Clock Cycle | Stage 1       | Stage 2       | Stage 3       | Stage 4       |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1           | Instruction 1 |               |               |               |
| 2           | Instruction 2 | Instruction 1 |               |               |
| 3           | Instruction 3 | Instruction 2 | Instruction 1 |               |
| 4           | Instruction 4 | Instruction 3 | Instruction 2 | Instruction 1 |
| 5           | …             | …             | …             | …             |
