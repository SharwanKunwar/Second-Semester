# Define Stact and Explain the stack organization.

A stack is a special memory structure that stores data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, meaning the last item pushed (stored) is the first item popped (retrieved).

* It is widely used to store return addresses, temporary data, and CPU registers during subroutine calls and interrupts.



## Stack Organization

### Stack Pointer (SP):

* A special-purpose register that always points to the top of the stack.

* It is updated automatically during push (decrement for 8085) and pop (increment for 8085) operations.

### Memory Area for Stack:

* Stack resides in a reserved portion of memory.

* In 8085, the stack can grow downward (from higher to lower memory addresses).

### Push Operation:

* Stores data onto the stack.

* SP is decremented, and data is placed at the new top.

### Pop Operation:

* Retrieves data from the stack.

* Data at the top is read, and SP is incremented to remove it.

### Example:

* If SP = 3000H and we push accumulator value:

    * SP → 2FFFH

    * Accumulator value stored at 2FFFH

* On pop, value at 2FFFH is retrieved, SP → 3000H
