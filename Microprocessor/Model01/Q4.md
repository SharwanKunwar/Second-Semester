## Explain the following instructions 
* a) LDA 7050H 
* b) CPI 35H 
* c) PUSH B

### a) LDA 7050H

* Meaning: Load Accumulator Direct

* Addressing Mode: Direct

* Operation:

* 𝐴
←
Memory[7050H]
A←Memory[7050H]

* Explanation: The instruction loads the contents of memory location 7050H into the accumulator.

* Example: If Memory[7050H] = 3CH, after execution, A = 3CH.

### b) CPI 35H

* Meaning: Compare Immediate with Accumulator

* Addressing Mode: Immediate

* Operation:

    * Subtract 35H from Accumulator (A) without storing result


* Effect on Flags:

    * Zero (Z) → Set if A = 35H

    * Carry (CY) → Set if A < 35H

    * Sign (S), Parity (P) → Updated according to result

* Explanation: This instruction compares the accumulator with 35H by internally subtracting 35H from A but does not change A.

* Example: If A = 30H, CY = 1, Z = 0

### c) PUSH B

* Meaning: Push Register Pair B & C onto Stack

* Addressing Mode: Implicit (Stack Operation)

* Operation:

    * Stack[SP-1]
←
𝐵
,
Stack[SP-2]
←
𝐶
,
𝑆
𝑃
←
𝑆
𝑃
−
2
Stack[SP-1]←B,Stack[SP-2]←C,SP←SP−2

* Explanation: Saves the contents of register pair B & C onto the stack for later use (like during subroutine calls).

* Example: If B = 12H and C = 34H, after execution, these values are stored at top of stack, and SP decreases by 2.

## Table in short

| Instruction | Meaning                      | Addressing Mode | Operation / Effect                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| LDA 7050H   | Load accumulator from memory | Direct          | A ← Memory\[7050H]                         |
| CPI 35H     | Compare immediate with A     | Immediate       | A - 35H, flags updated, A unchanged        |
| PUSH B      | Push register pair B & C     | Implicit        | B & C stored on stack, SP decremented by 2 |
