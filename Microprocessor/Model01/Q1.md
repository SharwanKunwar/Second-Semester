# what is instruction mapping? Explain how to convert an instructioncode to a microinstruction address.
Instruction mapping is the process of converting an instructionâ€™s opcode into the starting address of its microprogram in control memory.

### Converting an Instruction Code to a Microinstruction Address

## Fetch the instruction:

The CPU fetches the machine instruction from memory and stores it in the Instruction Register (IR).

## Extract the opcode:

Only the opcode bits of the instruction are needed for mapping (operands are ignored).

## Use mapping logic:

The mapping logic (like a mapping ROM or hardwired decoder) takes the opcode and generates the starting address of the microprogram in control memory.

## Access control memory:

The control memory (microprogram memory) uses this starting address to fetch the first microinstruction.

## Execute microinstructions:

The microprogram sequencer then generates the next microinstruction addresses sequentially (or via branching) until the instruction execution is complete.
