## what is microprogram sequencer? differentiate between hardwired control unit and microprogrammed control unit
A microprogram sequencer is a control unit component in a CPU that generates the address of the next microinstruction to be executed from the control memory (ROM or control store).

* Think of it as a program counter for microinstructions.

* It ensures that the CPU executes microinstructions in the correct sequence (just like instructions in a program).

* It also handles branching in microprograms (conditional or unconditional jumps).




 ### 1. Hardwired = fast but rigid.
Control signals are generated using fixed combinational logic circuits (gates, flip-flops, decoders).

### 2. Microprogrammed = slower but flexible.
Control signals are generated using a sequence of microinstructions stored in control memory.
