## What is the use of flag? Explain different flags of 8085 with an example.

In the 8085 microprocessor, a flag is a type of flip-flop that indicates the status of the result after an arithmetic or logical operation.

*  They are stored in the flag register (also called the status register).
*  Flags are automatically set (1) or reset (0) by the processor depending on the result of the operation.
*  They help in decision-making (branching, conditional jumps, loops).

### Different Flags in 8085
There are 5 main flags:

* Sign Flag (S)
    * Indicates the sign of the result (in 2’s complement form).
    * S = 1 → Result is negative.
    * S = 0 → Result is positive.

* Zero Flag (Z)

    * Shows whether the result is zero.
    * Z = 1 → Result is zero.
    * Z = 0 → Result is non-zero.

* Auxiliary Carry Flag (AC)

    * Used in BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) arithmetic.
    * Set when there is a carry from lower nibble (D3) to upper nibble (D4).

* Parity Flag (P)
    * Checks whether the result has even or odd parity.
    * P = 1 → Even parity (even number of 1’s in result).
    * P = 0 → Odd parity.

* Carry Flag (CY)
    * Indicates carry (in addition) or borrow (in subtraction).
    * CY = 1 → Carry/borrow is generated.
    * CY = 0 → No carry/borrow.

example:

```
MVI A, 8EH   ; Load A with 8E (10001110)
ADI 92H      ; Add 92H to A
```
