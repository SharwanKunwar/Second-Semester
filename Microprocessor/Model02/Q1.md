# What is parrallel processing? write benefits and Explain the classification of parrallel processing by M.J.Flynn.

Parallel processing is the technique of performing multiple tasks simultaneously by dividing a problem into smaller parts and executing them at the same time using multiple processors or cores.



### Benefits of parallel processing

**Faster execution**
– Tasks are divided among multiple processors, reducing overall processing time.

**Handles large data** – Efficiently processes massive datasets that would be slow in serial processing.

**Better resource utilization** – Uses multiple CPUs/cores simultaneously, preventing idle hardware.

**Improved system performance** – Enhances speed and responsiveness for complex applications.

**Scalability** – Systems can be expanded by adding more processors to meet higher demands.


<br>

**M. J. Flynn (1966)** classified computer architectures for **parallel processing** based on the number of **instruction streams** and **data streams** being processed at the same time.
This classification is called **Flynn’s Taxonomy.**


* SISD → Traditional sequential system

* SIMD → Same instruction, many data (parallel data processing)

* MISD → Many instructions, one data (rare)

* MIMD → Many instructions, many data (modern systems)
