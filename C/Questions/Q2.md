## # Define operator. Explain any four types of operators available in c?

An operator in C is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform a specific mathematical, logical, or relational operation on variables or values. Operators are used to manipulate data and variables in programs.

*  Types of Operators in C:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description           | Example  |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              | `a == b` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `a != b` |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `a > b`  |
| `<`      | Less than             | `a < b`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `a >= b` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `a <= b` |

<br>

### 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
| Operator | Description           | Example  |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              | `a == b` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `a != b` |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `a > b`  |
| `<`      | Less than             | `a < b`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `a >= b` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `a <= b` |

<br>

### 3. Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example            |            |          |   |          |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---------- | -------- | - | -------- |
| `&&`     | Logical AND | `(a > 0 && b > 0)` |            |          |   |          |
| \`       |             | \`                 |
| `!`      | Logical NOT | `!(a > b)`         |            |          |   |          |

<br>

### 4. Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description         | Example  |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `=`      | Assign value        | `a = 5`  |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `a += 2` |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `a -= 3` |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `a *= 4` |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `a /= 2` |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign  | `a %= 2` |
