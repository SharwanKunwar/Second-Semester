## Why DMA is used in c language? write a program to enter age of 20 students and count age between18 and 25 from the array usng dma function

### Why is DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation) used in C language?
DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation) is used in C to allocate memory during runtime instead of compile-time. It is useful when:

* The size of data is unknown at compile time.
* We want efficient memory usage.
* We want to allocate/free memory as needed using pointers.

C provides four standard library functions for DMA **(from <stdlib.h>)**:

* malloc() – Allocates memory.
* calloc() – Allocates memory and initializes it to 0.
* realloc() – Changes the size of previously allocated memory.
* free() – Frees the allocated memory.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int countAgesInRange(int *ages, int size);

int main() {
    int *ages;
    int count;

    // Dynamically allocate memory for 20 integers
    ages = (int *)malloc(20 * sizeof(int));

    if (ages == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1; // Exit if memory allocation fails
    }

    // Input age of 20 students
    printf("Enter age of 20 students:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        printf("Age of student %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &ages[i]);
    }

    // Count and display how many students are aged between 18 and 25
    count = countAgesInRange(ages, 20);
    printf("Number of students aged between 18 and 25: %d\n", count);

    // Free the dynamically allocated memory
    free(ages);

    return 0;
}

// Function to count ages in range
int countAgesInRange(int *ages, int size) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (ages[i] >= 18 && ages[i] <= 25) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

```
