## Difference between union and structure?

###  What is Union in C ?

A union is a user-defined data type in C that allows storing different types of data in the same memory location. It can have multiple members, but only one member can hold a value at a time because all members share the same memory.

* Syntax:

```c 
union UnionName {
    int i;
    float f;
    char ch;
};
```

### What is Structure in C ?
A structure is also a user-defined data type in C that allows grouping variables of different data types under one name. Each member has its own memory location, so all members can hold values at the same time.

* Syntax:

```c 
struct StructName {
    int i;
    float f;
    char ch;
};
```

| **Feature**     | **Structure (`struct`)**                          | **Union (`union`)**                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory**       | Each member has its own memory location.           | All members share the same memory location.      |
| **Size**         | Sum of sizes of all members.                       | Size of the largest member.                      |
| **Access**       | All members can be used at the same time.          | Only one member can be used at a time.           |
| **Use Case**     | When you need to store multiple values.            | When you need to store only one at a time.       |
| **Example Use**  | Student record (name, roll, marks).                | Multiple formats of the same data (int/float).   |
