## How will you define pointer?

A pointer in C (and many other languages) is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a direct value (like 10 or 'A'), a pointer holds the location in memory where that value is stored.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;       // normal variable
    int *ptr =&x;     // pinter variable assigned address

 

    printf("Before changing the value of x\n");
    printf("x = %d\n", x);

    // change value of x using pointer
    *ptr = 25;

    printf("\nAfter changing through pointer:\n");
    printf("x = %d\n", x);

    return 0;
}

```
