## Why do you use DMA instead of array? Explain DMA with suitable example


### Flexibility in size:

* A normal array in C has a fixed size determined at compile time.

* DMA allows you to allocate memory at runtime, depending on user input or program requirements.

### Efficient memory usage:

* With arrays, you might allocate more memory than needed.

* DMA allocates exactly what you need, saving memory.

### Lifetime control:

* Memory allocated dynamically can exist until you free it.

* Local arrays are destroyed automatically when the function ends.

### Handling large data:

* Very large arrays might exceed stack size if declared locally.

* DMA allocates memory on the heap, which is much larger.


## **Example:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    int *arr;  // pointer for dynamic array

    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // allocate memory dynamically
    arr = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // input elements
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Enter element %d: ", i+1);
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    // display elements
    printf("Elements are: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }

    // free allocated memory
    free(arr);

    return 0;
}
