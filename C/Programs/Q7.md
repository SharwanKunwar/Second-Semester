# Write a program to copy content from one file to another using file handling.

Assume there are two files: secA and secB. The file secA already contains some data. The task is to copy the contents of secA into secB, so that both files have the same data.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *secA, *secB;
    char ch;

    // Open secA.txt for reading
    secA = fopen("secA.txt", "r");
    if (secA == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Cannot open secA.txt for reading.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Open secB.txt for writing
    secB = fopen("secB.txt", "w");
    if (secB == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Cannot open secB.txt for writing.\n");
        fclose(secA);
        return 1;
    }

    // Copy contents from secA to secB character by character
    while ((ch = fgetc(secA)) != EOF) {
        fputc(ch, secB);
    }

    printf("Contents of secA.txt successfully copied to secB.txt\n");

    // Close both files
    fclose(secA);
    fclose(secB);

    return 0;
}
