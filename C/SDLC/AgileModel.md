# What is agile model?
Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams and customers.

## Key Principles of Agile
* Iterative Development – Build software in small cycles (called iterations or sprints).

* Customer Collaboration – Involve the client at every stage.

* Flexibility – Respond to changes even late in the project.

* Working Software First – Deliver functional parts of the software early.

* Team Communication – Daily stand-up meetings for updates.


## Phases of Agile Development

### Planning

* Create a product backlog (list of features).
* Prioritize based on importance.

### Design

* Plan architecture and basic design for the sprint.

### Development

* Build features in short cycles (2–4 weeks).

### Testing

* Continuous testing during and after development.

### Review

* Demonstrate the working product to the customer for feedback.

### Release & Maintenance

* Deliver the product increment.

* Maintain and update in future sprints.
