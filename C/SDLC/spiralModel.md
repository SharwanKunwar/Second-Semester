# what is spiral model?
The Spiral Model is a software development process where the project is developed in iterative cycles, and each cycle involves planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation.

## Phases of the Spiral Model
Each loop of the spiral has four main phases:

### Planning

* Identify objectives, alternatives, and constraints.
* Determine requirements for that iteration.

### Risk Analysis

* Identify and evaluate risks (technical, financial, operational).

* Create prototypes if needed to reduce uncertainty.

* Engineering (Development & Testing)

* Develop the software for that iteration.

* Test to ensure it meets the iteration's goals.

### Evaluation

* Review results with the customer.

* Plan for the next iteration (next spiral).


## Characteristics
* Focuses on risk management at every stage.
* Uses prototyping to clarify requirements.
* Allows changes after each cycle.


## Advantages
* Good for large and high-risk projects.
* Flexible â€” requirements can change over time.
* Problems can be detected early through prototypes.

## Disadvantages
* Can be expensive and time-consuming.
* Requires expertise in risk analysis.
* Not suitable for small projects.
