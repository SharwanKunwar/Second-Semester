### Common SDLC Models

* Waterfall Model – Sequential phase-by-phase approach.
Iterative Model – Build in small repeated cycles.

* Spiral Model – Combines design and prototyping with risk analysis.

* Agile Model – Flexible, fast delivery in short sprints.

# Waterfall model 

The Waterfall Model is one of the oldest and simplest models of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
It is called “Waterfall” because the development process flows downward through fixed stages — like a waterfall — without going back to a previous stage.

It is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.


### Phases of the Waterfall Model

#### Requirement Analysis

  * Gather all requirements from the client.
  * Output: Requirement Specification Document.

 #### System Design

  * Create high-level and low-level designs based on requirements. 
  * Decide architecture, database structure, interface designs.

#### Implementation (Coding)

* Write the program in the chosen language (like C).
Follow the design exactly.

#### Testing

* Check the developed software for bugs and errors.
* Make sure it works as per requirements.

#### Deployment

* Install the software in the actual environment.
* Give it to the users for use.

#### Maintenance

* Fix problems found after delivery.
* Add updates or improvements.


## Characteristics
* Sequential: One phase finishes before the next starts.
* Rigid: Changes are hard to make once you move to the next phase.
* Document-Heavy: Requires proper documentation for each phase.


## Advantages

* Simple and easy to understand.
* Well-structured for projects with clear requirements.
* Easy to manage due to fixed phases.


## Disadvantages

* Not flexible for changes after development starts.
* Difficult to go back and make modifications.
* Testing happens late in the process, so issues may be costly to fix.
