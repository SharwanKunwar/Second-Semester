## How does the story 'billenium' picture one of the most buring problems in cities-the shortage of space and the challenges faced by over-population?

Brian Aldiss’s story “Billenium” is a satire that directly shows the burning problem of overpopulation and shortage of space in cities.



* **Overpopulation and Space Shortage:** <br>
The story “Billenium” by Brian Aldiss presents a future where unchecked population growth has led to extreme overcrowding in cities. Every inch of land is occupied, and housing has shrunk to cubicles of only 4 square meters per person.

* **Loss of Privacy and Human Dignity:** <br>
In such cramped conditions, individuals lose privacy, comfort, and freedom. Human life is reduced to mere survival, showing how overpopulation strips away dignity and individuality.

* **Discovery of Extra Space:** <br>
The protagonist, Ward, discovers a hidden storage room that is larger than the usual cubicle. This symbolizes the rarity and preciousness of extra space in an overcrowded world.

* **Irony of Human Nature:** <br>
 Initially, the room brings relief and freedom, but soon more people join in, and it becomes as crowded as before. This irony highlights how population pressure consumes any available resource.

* **Reflection of a Burning Problem:** <br>
The story is a powerful satire on one of the biggest urban problems—overpopulation. It shows that without population control, space shortage, loss of comfort, and destruction of individuality will only worsen, and temporary solutions will fail.
