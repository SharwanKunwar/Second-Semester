## What are the key points to remember while composing a letter?

* **Clarity of Purpose:** State the main idea clearly and directly.

* **Proper Format:** Follow the correct structure (sender’s address, date, receiver’s address, salutation, body, closing, signature).

* **Tone:** Use polite and appropriate language (formal for official letters, friendly for personal ones).

* **Conciseness:** Keep the letter brief and to the point—avoid unnecessary details.

* **Correctness:** Check grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

* **Coherence:** Arrange ideas logically, with smooth flow from one paragraph to another.

* **Neatness:** If handwritten, keep it clean and legible; if typed, use a readable font.

* **Completeness:** Include all necessary details (like subject, reference, contact info, or enclosures if required).
