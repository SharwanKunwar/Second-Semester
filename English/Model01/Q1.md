## Can human be replaced by machine according to Brian aldiss in his story 'who can replace a man?'

In Brian Aldiss’s short story “Who Can Replace a Man?”, the idea of whether machines can replace humans is explored through irony and a kind of dark humor.

In the story, machines (robots of different grades) discover that all humans have died because of starvation. At first, they feel free and begin to think they can now rule the world on their own. The lower-grade robots obey higher-grade ones, but they still lack true independence and creativity. Eventually, they encounter the last surviving human, who, weak with hunger, simply orders them to fetch food. Despite all their intelligence and strength, the machines immediately obey him.

Aldiss shows that machines, no matter how advanced, cannot truly replace humans because they lack qualities like imagination, emotion, creativity, and the ability to give meaning to life. They are bound by their programming and hierarchy. The last scene proves that even a weak human still holds authority over machines.

So according to Aldiss, humans cannot be replaced by machines, because machines are limited to mechanical intelligence, while humans possess deeper qualities that make them unique.
